snpl package documentation
==========================

What is it?
-----------

``snpl`` is a pure-Python package for in-house use in Yoshie lab
at the Institute of Industrial Science, the University of Tokyo. 

It serves mainly for three purposes. 
First, it provides a thin wrapper to ``matplotlib.pyplot`` 
with some utilities that make daily plotting tasks much easier. 
This is mainly handled in the main ``snpl`` module. 
Some additional utilities are available in ``snpl.util`` module. 
Second, it provides parsers for data formats used in the lab. 
It uses the hicsv_ object as a unified data interface.
